</p>

The browsergame framework is based on the New-Star web browser game engine [New-Star](https://github.com/Yaro2709/New-Star)
and the open source browsergame framework [2Moons](https://github.com/jkroepke/2Moons). 

Full source code is placed at [https://github.com/eyvalon/EyvalonMoons](https://github.com/eyvalon/EyvalonMoons) repository.
The browsergame is for the Eyvalon Community purposes. The opportunity was given to change the game code by the Eyvalonier as a contribution to 2Moons.
There are many things to modify starting from **graphics, languages, code improvements up to EyvalonGames integration and bughunting**.
